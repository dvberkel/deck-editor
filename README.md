Deck Editor
===========

[deck.js][1] is a JavaScript framework that enables a user to create
modern HTML presentations.

While at [JSConf EU 2012][2] I got inspired and wanted to created an
in-browser deck editor.

The idea is to have a side by side view of the source and the result
as rendered by deck.js.

Components
----------

The following components seem to come to mind when thinking about this
project and will likely be incorporated.
